1. Description:
---------------
PIC24F have some different Output Compare modules for different families. 
PIC24FJ256GA110 and PIC24FJ256GB110 families have up to 9 Output Compare channels with dedicated timer. 
This code example is for these two PIC24F families. 

Pin #23, #24, #32, #33, #72, #71, #70, #69, #76 on Explorer 16 with PIC24FJ256GA110 PIM or PIC24FJ256GB110 PIM are 9 output compare modules (OC1 - OC9) respectively. 

This code example is tested on PIC24FJ256GA110 and PIC24FJ256GB110.
 
PIC24FJ256GA110 family and PIC24FJ256GB110 family have a different 
Output Compare module, please read datasheet for more detail. 


The Family Reference Manual has two sections about Output Compare, 

For PIC24FJ256GA110 and PIC24FJ256GB110 family, please refer 
Section 35. Output Compare with Dedicated Timer. 

For PIC24FJ128GA010 and PIC24FJ64GA004 family, please refer 
Section 16. Output Compare. 


2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB?C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB?IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB?IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.

f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
        a. Explorer 16 Demo board with one of the following MCU PIM
	PIC24FJ256GA110 or PIC24FJ256GB110

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different PIC24F device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any PIC24F device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB?IDE to a PIC24F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB?C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Re-build the MPLAB?project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        e. Download the hex file into the device and run.
